# HabitLoop

# 🌱 Personal Habit Loop Tracker

A modern and minimalist **frontend-only habit tracking web app** designed to help users visualize and reinforce daily habits through cue-routine-reward loops, streaks, and mood-driven habit tracking.

---

## 🔥 Features

### 🔄 Loop Rings  
Visualize your habits as **Cue → Routine → Reward** circles to understand the behavioral loop. Each ring shows your progress in a day.

### 🔥 Streak Flame  
Build consistency! A **flame icon grows** with each day you complete a habit streak — skip a day and it shrinks.

### 😊 Mood Boosters  
Select your **mood for the day**, and the app suggests habit focus areas based on how you're feeling (happy, sad, tired, energetic, etc).

### ⏳ Time Slider  
Use a slider to **scroll through past days** and track your progress visually. Replay your growth history!

### 🏅 Habit Badges  
Unlock fun, motivational **badges** as you hit habit milestones like "7-Day Streak", "First Flame", "Mood Master", and more.
